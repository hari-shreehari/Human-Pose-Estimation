# Human-Pose-Estimation

Human Pose Detection Model using the
MobileNetV2 architecture with the COCO dataset, aimed at accurately identifying and
predicting human keypoints for various pose estimation tasks. The model leverages the
lightweight and efficient MobileNetV2 backbone, making it suitable for real-time
applications where computational resources are limited. The COCO dataset, which
provides comprehensive annotations for human keypoints, serves as the foundation for
training and evaluation.

The model is designed to detect 17 human keypoints, including major joints such
as shoulders, elbows, knees, and ankles. Optimization techniques such as learning rate
scheduling and data augmentation are employed to enhance performance. The results
are evaluated using mean average precision (mAP) and accuracy metrics specific to
pose estimation. The model demonstrates its effectiveness in both accuracy and
computational efficiency, making it viable for real-time human activity tracking, motion
analysis, and applications in sports, health, and entertainment.
